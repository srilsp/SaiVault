I had to do both, actually couple of them due to project and customer requirement. LFCS, RHCSA, RHCE, Two more related to Oracle Solaris.
Personally speaking, I prefer linux foundation certs over any other vendor specific cert. I've learned maximum when prepping for LFCs cert.

Also, after completing RHCE.. i still used to lack confidence with Ubuntu and Suse distro.  
But yes, having RH cert definitely add some weight to your resume!

We already have gentoo on AWS marketplace. We even have kali, blackarch and what not! ![:sweat_smile:](https://a.slack-edge.com/production-standard-emoji-assets/14.0/google-medium/1f605@2x.png) But we only support major one.. - [https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/faqs/](https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/faqs/)

I used to teach for the LPIC (1 to 3), and yeah in France/Europe companies only cared about RHCE for certifications (except if you want to work for companies invested in open source), but tbh I don’t think people care that much if you have previous experience working with RH (even without). As Horacio says, they’re all the same deep down, only the userland layer is different, but nothing you can’t learn fast
